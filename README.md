# 2019OfficialRelease
Ready for the game "Destination Deep Space"
Our Robot's name is "Boreas" honoring mentors Bruce, and Bob. It also stands for the Greek god of winter/cold.
Boreas has an arm, a jack, cams, a lift, and a 6-wheel drivetrain. Each one (except for the lift) is operated by a TalonSRX.
The lift is operated by a NEO Brushless motor. 
There are limit switches for the NEO, but otherwise, the Talons that have encoders have breakoutboards so that limits don't need code

Due to a rename, there are two folders with the exact same code (Feb 24th, 2019). Until the content of the Boreas Folder is verified, the code will be used on the OG meme folder "Scorpio2(ElectricBugaloo)"
