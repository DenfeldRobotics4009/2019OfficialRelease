Ready for the game "Destination Deep Space"
Our Robot's name is "Boreas" in memory of mentors Bruce, and Bob. It also stands for the Greek god of winter/cold.
Boreas has an arm, a jack, cams, a lift, and a 6-wheel drivetrain. Each one (except for the lift) is operated by a TalonSRX.
The lift is operated by a NEO Brushless motor. 
There are limit switches for the NEO, but otherwise, the Talons that have encoders have breakoutboards so that limits don't need code
